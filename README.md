# Peeks

![Peeks Logo](logo.gif)

## Description

Peeks is a Windows OS assistant/pet designed to take voice commands and execute them on the desktop. The included images animate eyes, giving it a personality or "lifelike" attitude.

## Current Features

- **Voice Commands**: "open firefox/load firefox" to load Mozilla and "exit" to close the program.
- **Movement**: The window slowly moves around the screen like a hermit crab.
- **Animations**: Several animations for idle and loading.
- **System Tray**: Exit function and graphic added to quick-launch.

## Getting Started

## Community

This project (while cute) is made for adult developers and may not be age-appropriate as more developers get their hands on it. Feel free to privately experiment, but if you want your iteration included in the official build, report back with a link to the repo and a copy of the changelog.
